# GroupChat_Java

This is a Java network group chat that uses multicast datagram sockets to send and receive data. 
Messages are encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm before being sent over the network and are decrypted once received. 
Users are notified when other users exit the chat.

Below is a short demo:
